# QAP-4-Files-JE
This is a repo that contains my python files for my 4th QAP at Keyin

It includes a group of files made to help the One Stop Insurance Company process and store customer's policies. This group includes the "main.py" file, the "OSICDef.dat", and "Policies.dat"
After main.py runs, it adds the related input values to the Policies file, as well as writing back the values taken from the Defaults file so everything stays up to date.

The Graph file is it's own project that allows the user to input the total sales for each month of the year, and then displays the values on a graph.
